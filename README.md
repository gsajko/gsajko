### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Grzegorz Sajko, a data practitioner with a fascination for large language models (LLMs).

Some bullet points about me:
- experience building API with FastAPI
- experience with GCP (Big Query, remote VM) and Docker
- one year long theory based Deep Learning bootcamp (focus on NLP)
- build full cycle ML personal project (Airflow, MLflow, streamlit)
- experiments with QLoRA, RAGs, and few shot prompting, using OpenAI API

currently, I'm exploring / learning about:
- MLOps
- DE for AI
